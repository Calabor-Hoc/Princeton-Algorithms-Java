My solutions to Robert Sedgewick's fantastic Princeton courses on Algorithms/Data Structures (http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) and Intro to Programming in Java (http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/).

See /alg for my Algorithms files and /introcs for my Intro to Programming in Java files.

I'm leading a group to study these courses each week: http://www.meetup.com/software-books/about/

If you are a student in these courses, PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT MY SOLUTIONS TILL YOU'VE TRIED THEM YOURSELF!!! If copying my code becomes a problem, I will post these on a private repository.

I will sometimes try to code these answers in Ruby as well as Java.
