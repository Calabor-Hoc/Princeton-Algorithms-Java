My solutions to Robert Sedgewick's fantastic Princeton courses on [Algorithms and Data Structures](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), **[Princeton CS 226](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos226/info.php)** and [Intro to Programming in Java](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/), **[Princeton CS 126](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos126/info.html)**.

See /alg for my Algorithms files and /introcs for my Intro to Programming in Java files.

If you're a student in these courses, **PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT MY SOLUTIONS TILL YOU'VE TRIED THEM YOURSELF**!!! If copying my code becomes a problem, I will post these on a private repository.

I'll sometimes try to code these answers in Ruby as well as Java. In the future, I want to translate everything here from Java to Ruby.
